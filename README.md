# react-esbuild-minimal
This is a minimal example of Esbuild working with React.

## Installation

Of course this requires that you have NodeJS installed

1. Clone the repository *(or download it manually)*

```
git clone https://github.com/Stradex/react-esbuild-minimal.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. Build and start server.

```
npm run start
```

*(If everything goes okay, the step 3 should generate a Bundle.js file at src/Bundle.js)*

Done!, you have already your Esbuild + React server running.
